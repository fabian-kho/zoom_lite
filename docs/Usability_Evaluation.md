## Usability Evaluation

**Examples of User-Centered Design (UCD) and usability goals we can consider during testing with users:**

1. Goal: Efficiency
    - How quickly can users complete specific tasks with the product/service?
    - How many clicks or steps are required to achieve a particular function?
    - Are there ways to streamline the workflow and reduce the time required for certain actions?

2. Goal: Ease of use
    - Is the user interface intuitive and easy to understand?
    - How easily can users navigate through the various functions and sections of the product/service?
    - Are there clear labels and instructions to help users understand and use them?

3. Goal: Fault tolerance
    - How well does the product/service detect and correct user errors?
    - Are users adequately notified of errors or invalid entries?
    - Are there mechanisms in place to undo or restore accidental actions?

4. Goal: Satisfaction
    - How satisfied are users with the overall experience of the product/service?
    - Does the product/service meet users' expectations and needs?
    - What aspects of the product/service contribute most to user satisfaction?

To address the above objectives, we can then ask the following questions:

1. What are your first impressions of the user interface?
2. Can you identify the main features of the product/service?
3. How easy was it for you to find and use the features you wanted?
4. Were there moments when you felt unsure or had difficulty continuing? If so, at what point?
5. Did you have trouble navigating the product/service?
6. Did you find the user interface engaging and user-friendly?
7. What improvements would you suggest for the current user interface?
8. Are there any other features or aspects you think we should consider?
9. Does the product/service meet user expectations and needs?
10. How would you rate your overall satisfaction with the product/service on a scale of 1-10?
